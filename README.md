Hi, I'm trying to get Home Brew installed on my MI Mac mini. 
I'm trying to access the SMART data on my ssd so I can try to anticipate failure accurately.
HomeBrew installed in Terminal, but I don't know what to put in for file path to save.
I followed instructions at MacWorld and came up with this: " File: /Users/frankshomefolder/.zshrcnano  " but it does not work. Perhaps I should add /Downloads or another folder?
